## Overview

This repository contains the research paper titled **"Application of Blockchain to Prevent Benami Transactions in Real Estate"**. The paper explores how blockchain, a decentralized and immutable ledger, can provide an innovative solution to tackle benami (anonymous) property transactions that undermine transparency and contribute to tax evasion in India's real estate sector.

Benami transactions occur when a property is bought under someone else's name, often with untraceable funds, to conceal the true ownership. This practice impacts India’s economy and skews real estate records. Using blockchain’s decentralized ledger, this paper proposes a model where transactions are secured, transparent, and traceable, significantly reducing opportunities for benami transactions.

## Key Features

- **Blockchain Architecture**: Discusses public, private, and federated blockchain networks, focusing on secure, transparent transactions using digital signatures.
- **Smart Contracts**: Leveraging smart contracts to automate property transactions, securely store user data, and validate identities without third-party intermediaries.
- **Validation Processes**: The system incorporates a multi-step validation for both buyers and sellers, requiring documentation like income source, identity proof, and property details.
- **IPFS for Document Storage**: Utilizes Interplanetary File System (IPFS) to store sensitive user documents in a secure, distributed manner, reducing latency and bandwidth usage.
- **Avoiding Black Money**: Only online payments are allowed, enforcing a fully transparent, taxable environment for property transactions.

## Methodology

The proposed system divides the transaction process into three main components:

1. **Seller Validation**: Registers the seller’s details in a blockchain block, including property area, owner ID, and verification via digital signatures.
2. **Buyer Validation**: Assesses buyer capability, identity, and financing options. Financial validation is done based on bank balances or loan documentation.
3. **Storage and Security**: Utilizes smart contracts for storing transaction details in blockchain and IPFS for document security, preventing data tampering and enhancing accessibility.

## Future Scope

Blockchain's immutability and transparency make it a promising solution for eliminating benami transactions in real estate, paving the way for further advancements in digital identity verification and real-time property validation processes.
